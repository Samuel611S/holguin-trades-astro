# Trading Signals Disclaimer

## Important Warning

Trading signals are for educational purposes only and should not be considered as financial advice. All trading involves substantial risk of loss.

## Signal Performance

Past signal performance does not guarantee future results. Market conditions change constantly, and what worked in the past may not work in the future.

## Your Responsibility

When using our signals:
- Conduct your own research before making trades
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- Use proper risk management techniques
- Consider your personal financial situation

## Signal Delivery

Signals are delivered via email, SMS, or our platform. Delivery times may vary due to technical issues or network delays.

## Market Conditions

Signals are generated based on market analysis during regular trading hours. Market conditions can change rapidly, especially during:
- News events
- Earnings announcements
- Economic data releases
- Geopolitical events

## No Guarantee

We make no guarantees about the accuracy, completeness, or profitability of our signals. Trading is inherently risky, and losses are a normal part of trading.

## Risk Factors

- Signals may become invalid quickly
- Market gaps can cause significant losses
- Slippage may affect entry and exit prices
- Technical issues may delay signal delivery

## Recommendation

Never trade with money you cannot afford to lose. Start with small position sizes and gradually increase as you gain experience.
