# Risk Management: The Key to Long-Term Trading Success

Risk management is the most important skill any trader can develop. It's what separates successful traders from those who blow up their accounts.

## The 1% Rule

Never risk more than 1% of your trading capital on a single trade. This simple rule can save your trading career.

**Example:**
- Account size: $10,000
- Maximum risk per trade: $100
- If your stop loss is $2 per share, you can buy 50 shares maximum

## Position Sizing

Calculate your position size based on:
1. Account size
2. Risk percentage
3. Distance to stop loss

## Stop Losses

Always use stop losses to limit your downside. Types include:
- **Fixed dollar amount**
- **Percentage-based**
- **Technical levels**

## Diversification

Don't put all your eggs in one basket:
- Trade different sectors
- Use various timeframes
- Consider different asset classes

## Risk-Reward Ratio

Aim for trades with at least a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio. This means if you risk $100, you should aim to make at least $200.

Remember: You can be wrong 50% of the time and still be profitable with proper risk management!
