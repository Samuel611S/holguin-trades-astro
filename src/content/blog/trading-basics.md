# Trading Basics: Your Complete Beginner's Guide

Starting your trading journey can feel overwhelming, but understanding these fundamental concepts will set you up for success.

## What is Trading?

Trading involves buying and selling financial instruments like stocks, options, futures, or forex with the goal of making a profit from price movements.

## Key Trading Concepts

### 1. Risk Management
Never risk more than you can afford to lose. A good rule of thumb is to risk no more than 1-2% of your account on any single trade.

### 2. Market Analysis
Learn to analyze markets using:
- **Technical Analysis**: Chart patterns and indicators
- **Fundamental Analysis**: Company financials and economic data

### 3. Trading Psychology
Emotions can be your biggest enemy. Develop discipline and stick to your trading plan.

## Getting Started

1. **Education First**: Learn before you earn
2. **Start Small**: Begin with paper trading
3. **Develop a Plan**: Create and follow a trading strategy
4. **Keep Records**: Track all your trades

Remember, successful trading is a marathon, not a sprint. Take time to learn and practice before risking significant capital.
